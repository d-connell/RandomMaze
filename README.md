# RandomMaze

This program creates a procedurally generated maze.
It then solves that maze.
Finally, the maze and its solution are printed to the screen.

The main branch uses a depth-first search algorithm.
The breadth-firth branch uses a breadth-first search algorithm.
The shortest-solution branch looks for all possible solutions, then displays the shortest of those.
