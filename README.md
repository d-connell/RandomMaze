# RandomMaze

This program creates a procedurally generated maze.
It then solves that maze.
Finally, the maze and its solution are printed to the screen.

The main branch uses a depth-first search algorithm and returns the first solution it finds.
The shortest-solution branch uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest way out of the maze.
